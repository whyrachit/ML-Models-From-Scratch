# Machine Learning Models from Scratch

## Overview

This project implements fundamental Machine Learning algorithms from scratch using Python. The models implemented include:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest**

By building these algorithms from the ground up, the goal is to understand the inner workings of popular ML models without relying on pre-built libraries such as `scikit-learn`. These implementations are purely based on core Python libraries such as `NumPy` and `Pandas` for numerical operations.
